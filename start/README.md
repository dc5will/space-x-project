# Apollo tutorial

This is the fullstack app for the [Apollo tutorial](http://apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/introduction.html). ðŸš€

## Motivation

Improving skills working with GraphQL by building a full-stack interactive app for reserving a seat on an upcoming SpaceX launch with the Apollo platform. 

## App Features
- User authentication with profile page
- Listing of upcoming launches
- Detailed view for each launch
- Checkout cart

## Built With
- JavaScript ES6
- ReactJS
- React Hooks
- Apollo
- GraphQL

## File structure

The app is split out into two folders:
- `start`: Starting point for the tutorial
- `final`: Final version

From within the `start` and `final` directories, there are two folders (one for `server` and one for `client`).

## Installation

To run the app, run these commands in two separate terminal windows from the root:

```bash
cd final/server && npm i && npm start
```

and

```bash
cd final/client && npm i && npm start
```
